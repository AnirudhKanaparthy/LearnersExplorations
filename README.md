# Basic Implementation Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains simple implementations of popular machine learning algorithms, created with the primary purpose of learning and understanding the underlying concepts. These algorithms are not intended for practical use, but rather as a learning tool to help grasp the fundamentals.

## Contents
The repository currently includes the following algorithms:

### Discriminative Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

### Generative Algorithms
- Gaussian Discriminant Analysis

### Sample Datasets
- abalone.csv
- stan_cs229.csv *(dataset given in CS229 ProblemSet-1)*
- cancer_reg.csv *(data.world)*
- linreg_sample.csv

---
## Note
The Linear Regression model won't be able to handle the `cancer_reg.csv` dataset in it's current form. The gradeint is either vanishing, exploding or is decreasing slowly.

## Future Additions
The following algorithms are planned for future implementation:

- Naive Bayes
- Softmax Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

---
## Getting Started
To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and edit the `main.py`. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file which you can import into your `main.py`.

## Improvements
If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. I am still learning!
